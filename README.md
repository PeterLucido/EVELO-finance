## Object of the application
In today's fast-paced world, it is essential to have reliable metrics to track and measure progress in various aspects of life. Without a clear understanding of where improvements are needed, it becomes nearly impossible to initiate effective changes. This finance application serves as the perfect solution, empowering you to meticulously monitor your expenses and gain valuable insights into your spending habits.

By providing a comprehensive overview of your financial landscape, this application enables you to identify areas that require adjustments and make informed decisions for a more secure financial future. Through data-driven analysis and intuitive visualizations, you can easily pinpoint where your money is being spent and recognize patterns that may be hindering your financial goals.

## Motivation
Every Tuesday, I've been diligently managing my finances using an Excel spreadsheet. However, I've been searching for a more visually appealing and user-friendly application that can simplify the process and elevate my financial management experience.

By transitioning to a more intuitive and aesthetically pleasing platform, I aim to enhance my engagement with my finances, making it easier to track expenses, identify trends, and make informed decisions for a more prosperous financial future.

## IceBox Items
I intend to categorize expenses by month, with each month's expenses calculated in the month-over-month section. This section will display the percentage, total, and average of each individual expense. Additionally, I'd like to incorporate a net worth page to monitor debt, cash, and assets for a comprehensive view of my financial situation.
